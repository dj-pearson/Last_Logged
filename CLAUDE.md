# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update CLAUDE.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update CLAUDE.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby CLAUDE.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md** - Look for CLAUDE.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good CLAUDE.md additions:**
- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update CLAUDE.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Browser Testing (If Available)

For any story that changes UI, verify it works in the browser if you have browser testing tools configured (e.g., via MCP):

1. Navigate to the relevant page
2. Verify the UI changes work as expected
3. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log

If no browser tools are available, note in your progress report that manual browser verification is needed.

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting

## Pearson Media — shared context

*Managed from the vault. Edit `14 - Resources/Shared CLAUDE Block.md` in the vault; direct edits between these markers are overwritten once a sync exists. Everything outside them is yours and is never touched.*

**The memory vault.** Portfolio-wide memory lives in the **Hermes** vault at `<your-home>\Documents\Hermes` (`C:\Users\dpearson\Documents\Hermes` on this machine; remote: https://github.com/dj-pearson/Hermes). It holds the profile, the map of all ten projects, and cross-project knowledge. Read `VAULT-INDEX.md` there when a task needs context beyond this repo. This repo's own `CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude` memory, and skills remain authoritative for work inside it — the vault supplements them, never replaces them.

**Name the project.** Pearson Media runs ten projects on a shared stack. Never say "the app," "the repo," or "production" without naming which one. A right answer about the wrong project is a wrong answer.

**The shared stack.** React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, self-hosted Supabase, Cloudflare Pages, Coolify on Contabo, Stripe. A problem solved in one repo is usually already solved for this one — check the vault before solving it twice.

**Secrets are references, never values.** Never write a password, key, or token value into a note, summary, commit, or setup doc; name where it's stored instead. Loose credential files exist under your `Documents` folder (`C:\Users\dpearson\Documents` on this machine) — never read one into a document.

**Never delete what Claude Code relies on.** Repo `CLAUDE.md` files, `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`, `.claude/skills/`, settings. Copy from them freely; removing or stubbing them is Dj's call alone.

**Evidence only.** Verify state from the actual file or command before claiming anything is done or in place. If unsure, say so and go find out.

**Write like a person.** Every model was trained on the same corpus, so the default register is recognisable within a sentence and it lands in commits, PR bodies, docs, UI copy and error strings alike. State the point first, then support it. Have an opinion; asked which of two, name one. Use real names and numbers, not categories. Never label your own significance ("important", "crucial", "worth noting", "notably"); if it matters the reader will see it. Banned outright: *delve, dive into, deep dive, unpack, shed light on, pave the way, usher in, tap into, supercharge, unlock, elevate, empower, streamline, curate, showcase, boast, groundbreaking, cutting-edge, transformative, game-changing, innovative, pivotal, invaluable, meticulous, bespoke, vibrant, multifaceted, holistic, testament, tapestry, synergy, cornerstone, treasure trove, plethora, myriad, moreover, furthermore, additionally.* Banned decoratively but fine literally: *navigate, harness, leverage, robust, comprehensive, landscape, realm, journey*; the test is whether a reader could check the claim. Banned phrases: *"In today's…", "It's important/worth noting", "When it comes to", "At its core", "At the end of the day", "This is where X comes in", "Let's break it down", "plays a crucial role", "cannot be overstated", "underscoring the importance of", "highlighting the need for"*, and the whole chat register (*"Great question!", "Absolutely!", "I'd be happy to", "Let me know if you need anything else", "I hope this helps"*). Banned structures, which imitate insight without carrying any: *"not just X, it's Y"*, *"not only X but Y"*, *"this isn't about X, it's about Y"*, *"No X. No Y. Just Z."*, the rule of three that goes abstract on the third item, the rhetorical question as a transition, and closing with a summary of what was just read. **At most one em dash** per piece of writing, never as the default connector; use commas, parentheses and semicolons. Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately. Uniform 18-word sentences are the signature that survives every word-level edit. Use contractions. Don't restate the question, don't open with a sweeping scene-setter, don't over-format (no emoji as structure, no header on a three-paragraph answer, no table for two rows). The one allowed exception is a **bold lead-in used as a heading** in a reference document like this one; a *run* of "**Bold term:** one sentence" bullets standing in for prose is the tell.

**Plain characters only.** Generated text carries Unicode that renders as ordinary punctuation, as ordinary whitespace, or as nothing at all, and it survives review precisely because it looks correct. **Anything a machine parses is ASCII unless the content requires otherwise**: code, config, JSON, YAML, CSV, SQL, regex, env values, filenames, URLs, commit subjects. Straight quotes `'` `"`, hyphen-minus `-`, three dots for an ellipsis, one ordinary space between words. Never emit curly quotes (U+2018/2019/201C/201D), en/em dashes (U+2013/2014), U+2026 ellipsis, U+2212 minus or U+2032 primes into code; a look-alike character in a PowerShell string or a SQL literal is a runtime failure, which is how `backup-databases.ps1` and `ssl-check.ps1` sat unparseable for months. Never emit a no-break space (U+00A0, and U+202F/2007/2009/2002/2003/3000), which breaks shell word-splitting, `grep` and column parsing while looking exactly like a space, or U+2028/U+2029, which are valid JSON and a syntax error inside a JS string literal. **Never emit an invisible or bidi character anywhere:** U+200B-U+200F, U+2060-U+2064, U+FEFF, U+00AD, U+034F, U+180E, the bidi controls U+202A-U+202E and U+2066-U+2069, and above all the Unicode tag block **U+E0000-U+E007F**, which encodes arbitrary ASCII invisibly and is the usual carrier for text a reviewer cannot see. Avoid homoglyphs (Cyrillic a/e/o/p/c/x, Greek omicron, fullwidth Latin, mathematical alphanumerics for bold): an identifier holding one compares unequal to the identifier it appears to be. Prose may use real typography and real accented names; prose may not carry characters that don't render. The one exception is a deliberate, load-bearing use, which carries a comment saying why. Scan with `rg -n '[\x{00AD}\x{034F}\x{061C}\x{180E}\x{200B}-\x{200F}\x{202A}-\x{202E}\x{2060}-\x{2064}\x{2066}-\x{2069}\x{FEFF}\x{E0000}-\x{E007F}]'`.

**Terminal output is scrollback, not a report.** Answer first — no "I'll start by", no restating the request, no narrating tool calls the transcript already shows. Don't summarise a diff the reader can see or paste back code you just wrote; one line naming what changed and where, with `file:line` because it's clickable. Length matches the question: a yes/no gets a yes/no plus the clause that makes it trustworthy, and under about six lines there are no headers, bullets or tables. Report actual output, not a paraphrase: quote the failing assertion, say what was skipped, say plainly what's verified and what isn't. No emoji and no status theatre; "246 tests, 246 passing" beats "✅ All tests passing!" and is falsifiable. Don't close with an offer of more help or unrequested next steps: ask a real question, or name the real remaining work. Commits are imperative, what and why, no launch copy. PR bodies say what changed, why, how it was verified, and what's still open.

**UI has a craft floor.** Every model trained on the same SaaS templates, so the *default* frontend output is a recognizable handful of tells — and Tailwind + shadcn/ui puts each of them one autocomplete away. Treat the following as the category's defaults rather than as bans: the brief's own words can earn any of them, but reaching for one on a free axis means you were not deciding. Refuse **purple/blue gradients and gradient text** (emphasis comes from weight and size); **Inter or a system default as the type *choice***; a colored **`border-left`/`border-right` above 1px** on cards, list items, callouts or alerts — the single most recognizable tell; grids of **same-size icon-tile + heading + text cards** as the page structure, and **cards nested in cards**; a **1px border under a wide soft shadow** (declare elevation once — border *or* shadow); **gray text on colored surfaces** (tint secondary text from the surface hue or the foreground); **bounce/elastic easing**; **monospace as a costume** for "technical" rather than for code, data or measurement; and a **tracked uppercase eyebrow over every section**. Keep body measure at 65–75ch, tracking no tighter than -0.04em, and card radii at 12–16px.

**Check UI, don't just intend it.** `npx impeccable detect <path>` runs 60 deterministic anti-pattern rules with no install, no API key and no LLM — it works from any repo, so there is no excuse for asserting a UI is clean. Use the `/impeccable` skill (`audit`, `critique`, `polish`, `colorize`, `typeset`) for the judgement calls it cannot make. Source: [Impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), Apache 2.0.
